# PyPoll

#![Vote-Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)
#
#* In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)
#
#* You will be give a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
#
#  * The total number of votes cast
#
#  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
#
#  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
#
#  * The total number of votes each candidate won
#
#  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
#
#* As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:
#
#  ```text
#  Election Results
#  -------------------------
#  Total Votes: 3521001
#  -------------------------
#  Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
#  Correy: 20.000% (704200)
#  Li: 14.000% (492940)
#  O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
#  -------------------------
#  Winner: Khan
#  -------------------------
#
#In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
